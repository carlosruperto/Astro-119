First homework graded: 10/10

Next time before merging your homework branch into your main branch, don't forget to link your pull request to the issue named creating homework. 
That would automatically close your issue after merging. And be sure to add a README.md file when creating a new repository, so that you TAs are able to 
put your grades and comments there. Thanks.
